# GW-Open-Data-Workshop

Gravitational Waves Open Data Workshop 2025

[Gravitational Waves Open Data Workshop 2025](https://gw-odw.thinkific.com/courses/odw2025) is the 8th in a series of workshops that started in 2018. The number of confirmed and analyzed detections by the LVK Collaboration in the last observing runs has climbed up to just shy of 100 and the list continues to grow as more confirmed detections are added.

The goal of the workshop is to provide a platform for the community to share their work and results using open data from the LVK Collaboration. The workshop will include talks, tutorials, and discussions on a variety of topics related to gravitational wave astronomy, including data analysis, astrophysics, and machine learning. The workshop will also provide an opportunity for participants to collaborate and network with other researchers in the field.

## About GWOSC

Gravitational Wave Open Science Center

The Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC), formerly known as the LIGO Open Science Center, was created to provide public access to gravitational-wave data products. The collaborations running LIGO, Virgo, GEO600, and KAGRA have all agreed to use GWOSC services as the primary access points for public data products. This collaborative approach benefits users by creating a uniform interface to access data from multiple observatories, and provides cost savings to the various observatories by sharing the tools, services, and human resources.

GWOSC is a collaboration between the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration. The GWOSC team is responsible for creating and maintaining the GWOSC website, as well as providing support to users of the data products. The team also works closely with the LSC, Virgo, and KAGRA collaborations to ensure that the data products are of the highest quality and are accessible to the public.

## Course Schedule

The workshop will be streamed live via Zoom from Monday, May 12 to Wednesday, May 14, each day from 9:00 to 10:30 AM Pacific Time (US and Canada). The Zoom room will open 8:45 AM.
